# General Questions
**What excites or interests you about coding? What did you learn this week?

Problem-solving is the aspect of coding that excites me the most. I enjoy finding solutions to complex problems and making the code as efficient as possible.

At present, I am focusing on practicing the React framework and working on basic projects to hone my skills. By building projects, I aim to gain more practical experience and understanding of the framework. 

**What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?

The most recent technical challenge I faced was understanding the State hook in React framework. As this was a new concept for me, I referred to the official documentation published by reactjs.org and also conducted additional research online to gain a better understanding and solve the issue.

**Talk about your preferred development environment (tools and technologies you prefer using) or a cool project that you've recently worked on (if any).

The tools and technologies that I have been using for programming are essential to my workflow. Specifically, I use VS Code as my code editor because of its user-friendly interface and customizable settings. I also use Chrome as my browser due to its compatibility with various web development tools and extensions. For local server setup, I prefer using XAMPP as it is a reliable and easy-to-use platform. Finally, I work on a Windows operating system which I find comfortable to use and efficient in handling programming tasks.

As I have been using these tools for quite some time, I have developed a familiarity and proficiency in working with them. Therefore, I would prefer to continue using these tools in the future to maintain my productivity and efficiency while coding.

Similarly, in order to gain a more in-depth understanding of the React framework, I have been working on a To Do List project.

**What is your general expectation from this internship program?

My primary expectation from this program is to gain valuable experience in the field of programming.

**What mediums do you prefer to learn programming?

The mediums I prefer to learn programming are online courses and tutorials, as well as hands-on experience through real-world projects.
